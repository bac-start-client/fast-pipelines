additional_scripts: # can I make this a select only script and run the same generalized upserts to force good design patterns??
  script-1: pipeline_1/sql_script_1.sql
  processing_type: full # for now, use full 


# the full type would take the body of SQL and rerun against the entire db. New rows are then determined, 
# upserts are executed accordingly
  # if the workflow is keeping track of changes over time, then the full load would only insert data
  # on new dates and update existing values that have changed
# maybe "incremental type" is useful, but having a hard time defining that at the moment
